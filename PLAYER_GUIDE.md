**Example Equipment:**

```
ShadowBane                           ← Fantasy name (Rare/Legendary only)
Steel Longsword (Item Level 8)       ← Base type and level
+35% Damage                          ← Base stat from Steel Longsword
+25% Critical Strike Chance          ← Modifier: "Deadly" prefix
+15% Critical Strike Multiplier      ← Part of "Deadly" prefix
+5% Life Steal                       ← Modifier: "of the Vampire" suffix

```

This is a **Rare weapon** (yellow) with 2 prefixes and 2 suffixes, total 4 modifiers.

### Equipment Strategy

**Early Game (Item Level 1-5):**
- Any equipment is good!
- Focus on **HP** and **damage** for survival
- Don't worry about perfect stats yet

**Mid Game (Item Level 6-10):**
- Look for **build synergies**:
  - **Crit build**: Stack crit chance + crit multiplier
  - **Tank build**: HP + regen + life steal
  - **Speed build**: Attack speed + CDR + movement speed
- Upgrade to blue/yellow items as you find them

**Late Game (Item Level 11+):**
- Hunt for **Legendary** equipment
- Build around your weapon choices
- Optimize stat combinations:
  - If you have **pierce weapons** (axe, lightning), stack **damage + crit**
  - If you have **fast weapons** (dagger, holy water), stack **attack speed + CDR**
  - Always keep some **life steal** for sustain

**Synergistic Stat Combos:**
- **Crit chance + Crit multiplier** = Huge damage spikes
- **Attack speed + CDR** = Extremely fast firing
- **Life steal + Damage** = More healing
- **Pierce + Range** = Hit many enemies from far away
- **XP gain + Gold gain** = Faster progression

## Inventory Management

### Item Collection
- Items **automatically attract** to you when nearby
- Different items have different attraction ranges
- **Equipment drops** (diamonds) have a larger attraction radius than regular items

### Inventory Tips
1. **Auto-stacking**: Same items stack automatically (up to 99 per slot for most items)
2. **Drag to reorganize**: Click and drag to move items between slots
3. **Stack similar items**: Drag one stack onto another to combine
4. **Swap items**: Drag one item onto a different item to swap positions

### What to Keep
**Always Keep:**
- **Gems, Essence** - Rare materials (for future features)
- **Equipment** - All equipment goes to Equipment screen, not inventory
- **Special items** (Vampire Ring, Lucky Coin)

**Can Discard:**
- **Excess resources** if inventory is full (Wood, Stone, Iron)
- You earn gold directly in runs, it doesn't take inventory space

## Village Building

### Building Priority

**For New Players:**
1. **Temple** (Level 1-2) - HP helps you survive longer
2. **Armory** (Level 1-2) - Damage helps kill enemies faster
3. **Academy** (Level 1-2) - XP gain means more upgrades per run
4. **Workshop** (Level 1-2) - Attack speed is great with multiple weapons

**For Experienced Players:**
1. Balance all buildings evenly
2. Or specialize:
   - **Offense build**: Max Armory + Workshop
   - **Tank build**: Max Temple + some Armory
   - **Fast leveling**: Max Academy + Temple

### Cost Efficiency
Early levels give the best value:
- Level 0→1: 50/75/100/60 gold (cheapest)
- Level 1→2: 75/113/150/90 gold
- Level 2→3: 113/169/225/135 gold
- **Don't over-invest** in one building early

**Strategy**: Get all buildings to level 2-3 before pushing any to level 5+

## Tips & Strategies

### Survival Tips
1. **Never stop moving** - Standing still = death
2. **Kite enemies** - Move in circles or figure-8 patterns
3. **Watch HP bar** - Don't be greedy, dodge instead of collecting items
4. **Elite enemies** - Worth the risk for equipment, but don't get surrounded
5. **Level up ASAP** - Don't delay collecting XP orbs

## Advanced Mechanics

### Critical Strike Math
```
Crit Chance: 25% → 1 in 4 attacks crits
Crit Multiplier: +50% → Crits deal 1.5× damage

Example:
Normal attack: 100 damage
Critical attack: 100 × 1.5 = 150 damage
```

### Life Steal Math
```
Life steal: 5%
Damage dealt: 200
Healing: 200 × 0.05 = 10 HP

Critical with lifesteal:
Damage: 200 × 1.5 = 300
Healing: 300 × 0.05 = 15 HP
```

### Attack Speed vs Cooldown Reduction
- **Attack Speed** reduces cooldown **multiplicatively**
- **CDR** reduces cooldown **additively** after attack speed

```
Base cooldown: 2.0 seconds
+50% Attack Speed → 2.0 / 1.5 = 1.33 seconds
Then -20% CDR → 1.33 × 0.8 = 1.07 seconds

They stack multiplicatively for fast firing!
```

### Damage Scaling
```
Weapon base damage: 25
Weapon level 3: 25 × 1.6 = 40
Village Armory level 5: ×1.5
Equipment damage: ×1.8

Final damage: 40 × 1.5 × 1.8 = 108 damage
With 25% crit chance at 1.5× multiplier:
Average damage: 108 × 0.75 + 162 × 0.25 = 121.5 damage
```
